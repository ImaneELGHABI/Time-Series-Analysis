# Time-Series-Analysis

Steps of this project: 
1. Series presentation (graph, simple and partial autocorrelations, etc.);
2. Decomposition of the chronological series;
3. Investigation of series nonstationarity (presence and nature using heuristic methods and Dickey and Fuller nonstationarity tests);
4. Determine the order of differentiation (d) in the ARIMA model;
5. Determine the order of the term AR(p); 6. Determine the order of the term MA(q);
7. How to handle a chronological series that is slightly under- or over-différenciée!
8. Select an ARIMA model (or models) based on the correctly stationnarized series using autocorrelations (simple, partial) and information criteria (AIC and BIC);
9. Estimation of the selected ARIMA model(s);
Validation tests on the estimated residuals of the (of) ARIMA model(s):
• Absence of autocorrelation: Ljung-Box test, 
• Absence of heteroscedasticity: Breusch-Pagan or White test, 
• Normality: Jarque Bera test
11. How to interpret residual traces in the ARIMA model (Standardized residuals, Distribution of residuals, Q-Q plot, and ACF plot);
12. Choose the appropriate model if there are several options available using projections (en échantillon);
13. Identifying the best ARIMA model using cross-validation of time series (Out-of-Time Cross Validation);
14 Precision measurements for chronological series predictions;
15. Predictions hors échantillon from 22/01/2022 to 22/02/2022;
16. How to do Auto Arima Forecast in Python.
